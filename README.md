This is a simple code that, once it's run, tracks keys pressed on the keyboard as well as text content inside the clipboard.


The information gathered through a keylogger and the clipboard logger are kept in separate .txt files, with the clipboard logger
keeping track of the time that text has been copied onto the clipboard.
